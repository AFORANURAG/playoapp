Welcome to the documentation of my project! This documentation will guide you through the different functionalities and features of the backend codebase. The backend is responsible for handling all the server-side operations, such as processing requests, communicating with the database, and serving responses.

<h3>before starting , i would like to tell you that , I was very interested in implementing my backend server in a react app but due to time constraint i was not able to so , however i will complete it in the near future.<h3>
